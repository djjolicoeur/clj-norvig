# clj-norvig

I recently started reading Paradigms of _Artificial Intelligence Programming: Case Studies in Common LISP_
by Peter Norvig and decided to use my language du-jour, Clojure, to tackle the exercises. If
you want to follow along, the book can be found [here](http://www.amazon.com/Paradigms-Artificial-Intelligence-Programming-Studies/dp/1558601910/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8).
